# DiscordImageBot

## Intro

This bot allows you to post images to a discord channel via a webhook. A full video tutorial on how to use this bot is available here: https://youtu.be/hfnEOyyOcnw

## Setup

To setup this bot you need to replace the placeholders in the script with your information. Hence, you will need the following information:
- Name, username, and password of your server
- MySQL Database
- Discord webhook

In addition, you should have a folder with images that you want to post to your discord. The images in the folder should be numbered starting from 0, i.e., "0.png" would be the first image followed by 1.png, 2.png and so on.
